# Maze
A Breadth-First Search to find the shortest path between two pixels in a maze image. We traverse the maze by converting it into a binary array, and then creating an unweighted, bi-directional graph out of this array. We can then traverse this graph with our search algorithm.

While I doubt this is the optimal solution for this problem, I had a lot of fun working on it and hope it is interesting to others.
